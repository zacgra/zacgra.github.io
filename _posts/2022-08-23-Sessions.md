1. A user enters their user name and password, then clicks login.
2. Next, the client sends a post request to the server with user's name and password, along with a cookie.
3. Rails router receives the request, uses the endpoint to redirect the request to a controller action.
4. The action next checks to see if the user is already in the database. If it is, it returns the User instance, otherwise it redirects to a new session login.
5. If the user is returned, the user is logged in.
6. In the process of logging in, the browser's cookie is set to the newly reset session token.
